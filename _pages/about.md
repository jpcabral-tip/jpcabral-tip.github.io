Hi! I am Pau, a Computer Engineering student.

When I am not doing any school works, I usually work on personal projects when inspiration comes in. This could be either doing an artwork that has been on my head for quite some time, building random things through code and present hardware, or learning something new for my own.

Currently, I am focusing on Penetration Testing through Capture the Flag challenges and walkthroughs provided at TryHackMe, and automation through Ansible as learned on my Systems Administration 2 class.

On rest days, I usually play video games, play the guitar, read comics, watch movies, play basketball (when there is no pandemic ;)), or just waste my time all-day on Reddit. I am a big fan of STAR WARS, and show much of my love for the franchise by either playing STAR WARS Battlefront II or rewatching the movies and the canon animated shows all day long. I also collect physical comic books, mainly on Spider-Man titles, which occupy much of the issues/trade paperbacks/hardcovers that I collect.


P.S. Penguins are the best! Waddle on! Noot Noot!
